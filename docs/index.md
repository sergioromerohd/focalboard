# TDT DBBASICO Plugin Documentation

Welcome to the TDT DBBASICO plugin project! We're very glad you want to check it out and perhaps contribute code to this project in GitHub.

## Install the plugin

Visit the [Mattermost Developer Documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/plugins/using-and-managing-plugins/#custom-plugins) for details on how to install and enable the TDT DBBASICO plugin in your self-hosted Mattermost instance.

## Enable the plugin

Once you've installed the TDT DBBASICO plugin, you can enable the plugin in the Mattermost System Console by going to **Plugins > Plugin Management**, and selecting the **Enable** option for the TDT DBBASICO plugin.

## Contribute to the TDT DBBASICO plugin project

Follow these simple steps to contribute:

1. [Fork the TDT DBBASICO repo](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard), clone it locally, and follow the steps in the README to build. Read the [TDT DBBASICO Developer's Guide](focalboard-dev-guide.md) and the [developer tips & tricks](dev-tips.md) documentation to get started.

2. Find [help wanted tickets that are up for grabs in GitHub](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22). Comment to let everyone know you’re working on it, and to allow a core contributor to assign the issue to you. If there’s no ticket for what you want to work on see [contributions without a ticket](contributions-without-ticket.md).

3. When your changes are ready, run through our [checklist for pull requests](contribution-checklist.md). Note that if it’s your first contribution, there is a standard [CLA](https://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) to sign.
